<h2>What is Foxxed?</h2>

<p>Foxxed is a discord server originally created by a group of high-school students from Green Hope High School. The server owner is currently Mark Feng, a furry and Warrior Cats enthusiast. Most of its members are now college students. It serves as a place for people to gather and meme in a toxic, but interesting environment.</p>

<h2>How can I Join?</h2>
<p>Not possible.
    Otherwise, you will have to bribe one of the members. Choose wisely because each member responds to bribes differently and some are easier to bribe than others.
</p>
<p>If you want a surefire way, ask Mark. Maybe give him an edible.</p>
