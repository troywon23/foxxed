<h2>What is Foxxed?</h2>

<p>Foxxed is a server originally created by a group of high-school students from Green Hope High School. The server owner is currently Mark Feng, a furry and Warrior Cats enthusiast. Most of its members are now college students.</p>
<br>
<h2>How can I Join?</h2>
<p>Not possible.</p>
<p>If you keep insisting, ask Mark. Maybe give him an edible.</p>
<br>
<h2>What is the point of this website?</h2>
<p>I just kinda wanted to practice web development and making this server seemed like a fun way to learn.</p>
